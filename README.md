# NOMAD, a portable app installer 

# Install
Run this command in a cmd
```shell
powershell -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/jonathanMelly/nomad/raw/main/install.bat -OutFile %TEMP%\downloaded.bat && %TEMP%\downloaded.bat
```
# Credits
This initial structure of this app was based on [goappmation](https://github.com/josephspurrier/goappmation).
It has then a lot evolved...

# Why ?
I needed a fast, reliable and simple way to manage portable apps (mainly on windows).

## Just use Scoop ?
If you like scoop, save yourself some time and stop reading this ;-)
Otherwise, go ahead :-)

# Other solutions ?
 * [portableapps](https://portableapps.com/) was too slow or buggy (do some fs stuff before/after run) 
 * [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) status was uncertain (it seems back on track now)

## 3.3.2023 brief comparison with scoop

| feature                         | scoop | nomad | comments                                                          |
|---------------------------------|-------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| checksums                       | yes   | no    | PR welcome                                                        |
| lots of apps                    | yes   | no    | Copy/paste a conf and adapt it for your needs                     |
| version pattern shortcut        | no    | yes   | I love it                                                         |
| shortcuts                       | yes   | yes   | Scoop uses shims... Nomad can use custom image index for shortcut |
| push for 100% portability       | no    | yes   | Example: putty conf not saved with scoop standard bucket          |
| uses github api (when possible) | no    | yes   | Consequence: Use less bandwidth but needs a PAT                   |
| single go binary                | no    | yes   | Scoop is a list of ps scripts                                     |


# Status
It is working (Iâ€™m using it at my work). Basic UI is the next big step.

# How
 1. Download [latest release](https://github.com/jonathanMelly/portable-app-installer/releases/latest)
 2. To install / update / get status an app (*Filezilla* for instance), start a terminal and run
```bash 
nomad i[nstall] filezilla
nomad up[grade] filezilla
nomad st[atus] filezilla
```
 1. To list available apps

```bash 
nomad l[ist]
```

1. To check status of all installed apps

```bash 
nomad st[atus]
```

- To check status of one app (installed or not)
    ```bash 
    nomad status filezilla
    ```
- To check status of multiple apps (installed or not)
  ```bash 
  nomad status filezilla rclone putty
  ```

 1. To view app version

```bash 
nomad v[ersion]
```

 1. To update nomad (and get new apps)

```bash 
nomad self
```

*Available apps are listed [here](cmd/nomad/app-definitions), and you can add yours by adding any valid json file 
in a folder named app-definitions OR in a [config file](config/nomad.toml) that must be placed in the same folder as the executable).
Please have a look at [Configuration](#configuration) for more info*

| -skip=false             | do not reuse already downloaded archive                             |
| -latest=false           | do not check for latest version (if url provided in config)         |
| -version=1.2.0          | install/upgrade/downgrade to custom version                         |
| -verbose                | verbose output useful for debug                                     |

## Other options
Please run
```bash 
nomad --help
```

# Configuration

## Zero Config by default
The single binary is self-sufficient (no need for any config)

## Opened for config
You may add a [nomad.toml](config/nomad.toml) in the same directory as the binary to configure any custom app definition and github token.

### Custom app definition
You can add any custom definition either in the nomad.toml config file or in a app-definitions directory in which you can put a json/toml definition
following [this structure](internal/pkg/data/data.go) (AppDefinition) or imitating [real examples](cmd/nomad/app-definitions)

### Github
To reduce network traffic, when possible, GitHub API is used to retrieve lastest app versions info.
As GitHub API limits traffic to guest requests, a PAT (GitHub token) is very useful, thus a generic token is included
and if you have a PAT (or it seems fairly easy for you to get one), please add it in your env (GITHUB_PAT) or put the following [file](config/nomad.toml) in 
the same directory as the binary to reduce pressure on the generic token.

#### Create a PAT
Please follow [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to create a basic PAT.

# Next steps
UI and lots of new apps
